## CoverCraft

Welcome to CoverCraft!

This an AI tool I built to generate cover letters based on resumes and job descriptions. I built it because I noticed that recruiters responded 5x more often when I included a cover letter in my application.

Built it and it works. Didn't deploy it because I don't want random people on the internet to waste my OpenAI credits

This project was the first time I ever worked with Stripe. It was an exhausting but useful learning experience. I learned how to set up Stripe webhooks and Supabase to update user credits for my application.
