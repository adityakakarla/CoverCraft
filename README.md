## CoverCraft

Welcome to CoverCraft!

This an AI tool I built to generate cover letters based on resumes and job descriptions. I built it because I noticed that recruiters responded 5x more often when I included a cover letter in my application.

This project was the first time I ever worked with Stripe. It was an exhausting but useful learning experience. I learned how to set up Stripe webhooks in my web app so that I could update a user's credit whenever they make a payment ðŸ’°.
